# ScioSense ENS16x Arduino Library
Arduino library for the ENS16x digital four channel MOX gas sensors with I2C interface from ScioSense.

## Introduction
This project is an Arduino *library*. It implements a driver with examples for the ENS16x sensor family.
ENS16x chips are digital gas sensors for TVOC and eCO2 with an I2C interface.

Note that the ENS16x requires a supply voltage of 1.71V .. 1.98V.
The ENS16x also requires a IO voltage of 1.71V .. 3.6V.

## Links
The ENS16x sensors are made by [Sciosense](http://www.sciosense.com).
 - The datasheet of the ENS16x sensors are available here: https://www.sciosense.com/products/environmental-sensors/digital-multi-gas-sensor/

## Prerequisites
It is assumed that
 - The Arduino IDE has been installed.
   If not, refer to "Install the Arduino Desktop IDE" on the
   [Arduino site](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage).
 - The library directory is at its default location.
   For me, that is `C:\Users\sciosense\Documents\Arduino\libraries`.

## Installation

### Installation via Arduino Library Manager
- In the Arduino IDE, navigate to the Arduino Library Manager on the left side (or, alternatively, select Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...)
- Search for `ScioSense_ENS16x`
- Select the library from the search results and press `Install`

### Manual installation
- Download the code from this repo via `Download ZIP`.
- In Arduino IDE, select Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP library... and browse to the just downloaded ZIP file.
- When the IDE is ready this README.md should be located at e.g. `C:\Users\sciosense\Documents\Arduino\libraries\ScioSense_ENS16x\README.md`.

## Build an example
To build an example sketch
 - (Re)start Arduino.
 - Open File > Example > Examples from Custom Libraries > ScioSense ENS16x > 01_Basic (or any other of the provided examples you wish to run)
 - Make sure Tools > Board lists the correct board.
 - Select Sketch > Verify/Compile.
